Scripting

Scripting means writing small programs (scripts) that automate repetitive tasks or control other software.

Python is ideal for scripting because it’s:
	interpreted (no need to compile),
	cross-platform (runs on Windows, macOS, Linux),
	has clear, readable syntax.

You just write the script → run it → get results instantly.

Common Scripting Tasks: Automation, Data Manipulation, Web Scraping, API Interaction, Task Scheduling.
