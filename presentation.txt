Title: Python in Scientific and Engineering Computing

Content:
Python — a standard in science and technology: used in physics, biology, finance, and engineering.

Powerful libraries:
SciPy, SymPy — complex mathematical, statistical, and symbolic computations.

matplotlib — data visualization, graphs, and models.
Advantages: integrates with other languages, handles large datasets efficiently, supported by an active scientific community.

Conclusion: a universal tool for scientific discoveries and engineering solutions.


#7
Title: Game development with Python

Content:
Easy to learn: even beginners can quickly create their own games.

Pygame — a library for creating 2D games (platformers, arcades, puzzles).

Panda3D — a 3D engine with physics, lighting, cameras, and VR support.

Python’s advantage: focus on game logic instead of technical complexity.

Great for learning and rapid prototyping of game ideas.

Title: Web development

Python is extensively used in web development, particularly for building dynamic web applications.

Why Python for Web Development? 
Advantages: Simplicity, extensive libraries, scalability, and integration capabilities.

Web Frameworks - allows developers to write Web applications or services without having to handle such low-level details as protocols, sockets or process/thread management.

Most popular high-level framework:
Django
	Initial release 21 July 2005; 20 years ago. Current release 5.2.7
	Includes ORM, admin panel, authentication, and much more out of the box.
	Great for: Large, data-driven applications that need fast development and scalability.

Popular Non Full-Stack Framework (for building APIs):
	Flask
	Initial release 1 April 2010; 15 years ago. Current release 3.1.2
	Includes WSGI Toolkit, routing, request handling and other.
	Great for: REST APIs, prototypes, and small-to-medium apps.

Title: Scripting

Scripting means writing small programs (scripts) that automate repetitive tasks or control other software.

Python is ideal for scripting because it’s:
	interpreted (no need to compile),
	cross-platform (runs on Windows, macOS, Linux),
	has clear, readable syntax.

You just write the script → run it → get results instantly.

Common Scripting Tasks: Automation, Data Manipulation, Web Scraping, API Interaction, Task Scheduling.
